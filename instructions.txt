Meta introduces Llama 3, the next generation of its open-source large language model (LLM). This release features pretrained and instruction-fine-tuned models with 8B and 70B parameters, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks.  Llama 3 is available on various platforms, including AWS, Databricks, Google Cloud, and Hugging Face, with support from AMD, AWS, Dell, Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm. Meta emphasizes responsible development and deployment, offering tools like Llama Guard 2, Code Shield, and CyberSec Eval 2 for safety. Future plans include introducing new capabilities, longer context windows, additional model sizes, and enhanced performance.

Large Language Model (in short LLM)
Key Goals for Llama 3
Striving for Excellence and Responsibility
Build the Best Open Models
Meta aimed to develop Llama 3 models that rival the best proprietary LLMs in performance and helpfulness. The company embraced an open-source philosophy, releasing models early and often for community feedback.  The initial text-based models are just the start, with future plans to introduce multilingual and multimodal capabilities, longer context windows, and improved overall performance.

Address Developer Feedback
Meta actively sought feedback from developers to enhance Llama 3's usefulness.  The company also prioritizes responsible use, playing a leading role in promoting ethical LLM development and deployment.
Embrace Open Source Ethos
Meta believes in releasing early and often to empower the community and accelerate innovation. This approach allows developers to access models during development and contribute to their evolution. The company is committed to fostering an open ecosystem where collaboration thrives.
Future Plans for Llama 3
Meta envisions a future where Llama 3 becomes multilingual and multimodal, capable of understanding and responding to multiple languages and formats.  The company aims to extend its context window, allowing the model to process and analyze larger amounts of information.  Continuous performance improvements are planned across core LLM capabilities like reasoning and coding, pushing the boundaries of AI.

Pushing the Boundaries of Language Modeling
Improved Pretraining & Post-training
Llama 3's 8B and 70B parameter models surpass Llama 2, achieving a new standard in LLM performance. Advanced pretraining and post-training techniques have yielded significant improvements, leading to the best available models at those scales. False refusal rates have been reduced, alignment enhanced, and response diversity increased.  Enhanced capabilities, including reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, make Llama 3 more steerable and responsive.
Human Evaluation Benchmark
Meta created a high-quality human evaluation set encompassing 12 key use cases, including coding, writing, and reasoning. The 70B instruction-following model outperforms Claude Sonnet, Mistral Medium, and GPT-3.5 in real-world scenarios, as assessed by human annotators.  The pretrained model also sets a new benchmark for LLMs at its scale.
Performance in Real-World Scenarios
Llama 3 was evaluated not just on standard benchmarks but also for real-world performance. The evaluation set was carefully curated to assess the model's ability to handle diverse prompts and tasks.  Human evaluators consistently favored the 70B instruction-following model over competitors, showcasing its strength in practical scenarios.
