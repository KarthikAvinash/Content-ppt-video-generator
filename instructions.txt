Introducing Meta Llama 3: The Most Capable Openly Available LLM to Date\n\nMeta Llama 3 is the next generation of our state-of-the-art open source large language model. It is now available on major cloud platforms and hardware platforms.\n\nWe are dedicated to developing Llama 3 responsibly and are introducing new trust and safety tools to help others use it responsibly as well. These tools include Llama Guard 2, Code Shield, and CyberSec Eval 2.\n\nIn the coming months, we expect to introduce new capabilities, longer context windows, additional model sizes, and enhanced performance, and we’ll share the Llama 3 research paper.

Llama 3 Architecture
Key Design Components
Decoder-Only Transformer Architecture
Llama 3 utilizes a standard decoder-only transformer architecture with key improvements: \n\n  Larger Vocabulary: A 128K token vocabulary for more efficient language encoding.\n  Grouped Query Attention (GQA): Enhances inference efficiency across 8B and 70B models.\n  Longer Sequence Length: Trained on 8,192 tokens, enabling processing of larger inputs.
Training Data
Llama 3 is trained on a massive dataset of 15T tokens. This data includes:\n\n  Publicly Available Sources:  Diverse range of text and code.\n  Multilingual Data: Over 30 languages are included, supporting future multilingual use cases.\n  Rigorous Data Filtering:  Multiple pipelines ensure high-quality data.
Scaling Up Pretraining
To optimize training, Meta developed scaling laws to guide the training process. This included:\n\n  Data Mix Optimization: Selecting the best data mix for various use cases.\n  Efficient Compute Utilization:  Maximizing GPU uptime and reducing training time.\n  Predicting Performance:  Evaluating model performance on key tasks before training.
